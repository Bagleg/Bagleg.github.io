          My goal for this project was to try and figure out what kind of pizza
          people tend to like based off their demographics. This data is important to
          me because I have always loved pizza. I have been getting into perfecting my 
          recipe, and I want to cater to as many people as possible. Pizza is a highly
          universal food, and as such, I want to be able to cater to anyone I am feeding
          additionally, this information could be useful to people trying to enter the
          market. This data provides fairly valuable information and helps newer businesses
          have the information they need to buy the ingredients and learn the styles paletable
          to their target demographic. Thank you for your interest in my work. Feel free to
          navigate the pages as you please. If you would like to contact me, you can do so

          As a prospective web developer, I decided to combine my interests. I learned
          a few skills so that I could make this data available on the internet. To do
          this, I learned HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React.js. I went from making rock, paper,
          scissors in python to making full-scale websites.
