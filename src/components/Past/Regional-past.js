        One of the most common variables that studies tend to link to, is regional 
        data. This is also the category has a lot of data which provide a few unique 
        angles on how preferences range throughout the country. That being said, 
        there is little overlap on the variables tested among these sources.

        The 2013 article on Mintel by Bethany Wall and the 2021 article on YouGov 
        America by Jamie Ballard touch upon regional data. Mintel provides a lot of 
        information regarding the toppings that are preferred in the various regions 
        noting that the Midwest and Southerners tend to have higher than average 
        favorability ratings on some toppings over other regions, but they also note 
        that they are unique in this sense as pizza toppings tend to be similar among
        regions (Wall, 2013). Sources didn’t particularly go into topping 
        preferences and the data presented from the Mintel article are rather 
        lackluster. As such, this study will be able to fill the gaps. In a similar 
        vain to topping preferences, Kathy Morris on an article for Zippia.com was 
        able to generate a map of the United States, where it shows the generable 
        favorability of pizza types as a whole. That being what kinds of specialty p
        izza people tend to prefer (think something like meat lovers pizza.) One 
        thing that the Wall (2013) article seemed to indicate was that the south 
        typically preferred extra cheese as a topping, however, the map produced by 
        Morris (2020) was able to show that the South typically preferred cheese 
        pizza. Whether that means extra cheese or not, there is a little bit of 
        overlap there.

        While toppings may be a boring field for already existing regional data, the 
        crust is a different story. National crust preference is split between 31% 
        in favor of thin crust, 29% in favor of “regular crust” and 18% in favor of 
        deep-dish crust. Regionally this is split with the northeast typically 
        preferring this regular crust, and the south being split 29% and 29% equally 
        between thin and regular crusts (Ballard, 2021). The Ballard article doesn’t 
        exactly explain what crust types exist. However, there are many out there. 
        Simply classifying them by “thin”, “thick”, and “regular” is insufficient 
        data. The 2019 Consumer Trend Report by PMQ magazine expands on this with 
        some very digestible graphs that depict the favored style of pizza per 
        region. Not only this, but it also has some crust consistency and crust 
        types. Regionally, their findings were that New York Style was the most 
        favored across the country, with its lowest opinion being 52% in the Midwest, 
        and the least favored being Neapolitan style nationally 
        (“Consumer Trend Report Reveals Favorite Pizza Styles”, 2019).

        This source is highly useful due to its extensive data. The source contains 
        more than New York Style, but styles widely used across America. Being able 
        to view these styles and compare their popularity, even in their local region, 
        is something that will be valuable. This can help ensure that this study has 
        relevant styles on a list of options. This source is simply a compiling of data 
        taken from a survey from Technomic inc. which is a reputable surveyor.

        In the 2020 article by Kathy Morris on Zippia.com, a graphic can be found 
        that contains a national graphic where all of the states are ranked based on 
        the number of pizza restaurants they have. The general findings were that 
        Connecticut was number one, followed by Pennsylvania and then followed by 
        Rhode Island (Morris, 2020). This is interesting because the 2015 PMQ Pizza 
        Power Report shows how the country is divided by states with more pizzerias 
        vs chains restaurants. All of the states that were found to be the top by the 
        Morris (2020) article also had more pizzerias than they had chains. The rest 
        of the PMQ magazine map shows that the Northeast and Southwest are largely 
        Independent dominated, and the rest of the country is chain-dominated 
        (“The 2015 Pizza Power Report”, 2015). This is useful information as this 
        could indicate that pizza is seen differently by people from each region.

        Lastly, an article titled Pizza Palates Changing provides a different take on 
        the pizza debate. It talks about the relevance of pizza as a whole, talking 
        about its impact on the economy, and lastly and most importantly, it talks 
        about sauce preferences by region. The general consensus that comes from this 
        article is that 25% of the northeast, 18% of the south, 17%of the Midwest, and 
        13% of the west prefer sweeter sauces (“Pizza Palates Changing”, 2009). This 
        information appears to be more unique, as less people take sauce as a factor.

	      Most of the studies shown in this section appear to be fragmented. Not many of 
        them directly overlap with information like how it does with toppings. This is 
        part of the goal of this study. To unite the information in a way that is 
        cohesive will lead to easier research for all.
