      While most of my sources focus on a lot of the basic elements of pizza, there are some studies out there that take a completely different approach. These are the kinds of studies that introduce factors that wouldn’t have been considered in the scope of this study.
      In a large group paper written by many Italian scholars, entitled Future Market of Pizza: Which Attributes Do They Matter? there is a heavy emphasis on the Italian Market and Margherita pizza, a style that didn’t fare so well in America according to the 2019 PMQ magazine Consumer Trend Report. The purpose of this academic paper is quite like what this study intends to do, but with a different market. Their results were a few tables showing the favorability of some intrinsic and extrinsic characteristics when it comes to pizza. These factors were rated on a scale of 1-7 with 1 being the lowest and 7 being the highest. The intrinsic factors were taste, which scored a 6.8; aroma, which got 6.4; Color of crust, which scored a 6.0; crunchiness, which scored a 5.9; saltiness, which scored a 5.3; softness of the dough, which scored a 4.8; and gumminess of the dough, which scored a 1.9. The extrinsic characteristics that were rated on the same scale included: Local raw material, which scored a 6.1; National origin of wheat, which scored a 5.8; price, which scored a 5.6; low environmental impact production, which scored a 5.5; and packaging, which scored a 4.6. 
      The 2019 Consumer trend report does overlaps with some of this information when they talk about crust texture on a scale from crispy to chewy. While they don’t exactly match up, as the Italian study only focuses on how these things are valued on a scale from one to seven, rather than how people prefer them (Di Vita et al., 2016).
      Next up, is an article written by a collective of FCS professionals where they incorporated vegetables in pizza crust to determine the likability as the number of vegetables increased. In this study, all the crusts were prepared the same, except some have an increasing presence of different vegetables. The study concluded that cauliflower crust ranked lower than the control, while zucchini crust ranked comparable to the control (Ghighi et al., 2017). Not one study in this review talked about vegetable crust, which begs the question: has anyone adopted this on a regional scale? Beyond just the regional scale, who prefers vegetable crusts? This study may have the potential to answer that question, so long as the right questions are asked on the survey.
      Lastly, an article entitled In Search of the Perfect Pizza. Despite what the title and context may imply, this is actually about frozen pizza. This article had a healthy spin attached to it as well, only making the pizzas that met a certain health standard to be accepted as the “perfect pizza”. The existence of this article seems to hint toward an overall movement towards healthy pizzas, which solidifies their standing in a pizza preference survey. The findings of this study produced a list that contains all of the frozen pizzas that met their health standards, and what pizzas really stood out as being tasty (Hurley & Liebman, 2003). While there is some amount of overlap within the nature of the study by Hurley and Liebman and that of the vegetable crust (Ghighi et al. 2017), information here is quite fragmented, and should be united into one study if they are determined to be truly valuable.
