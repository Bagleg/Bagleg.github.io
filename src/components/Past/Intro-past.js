      The research that has been done thus far has provided some of the national 
      trends, with details about toping preference, crust style, and consistency, 
      with most of the studies cited linking to things like where the participant 
      was from. There is little mention of some of the other factors, such as race, 
      gender, or age. Some of the studies mentioned below use this information, 
      however only really apply it to toppings, not crust types or any other factors. 
      This is where the uniqueness of this study comes into play.
