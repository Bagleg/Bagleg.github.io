        There are copious amounts of studies that exist on this topic. 
        From national topping preferences to the likability of healthy crusts, 
        and where some of these factors lie within the regional map of the United 
        States. This information is out there purely to be digested; however, nothing 
        is done from there. The purpose of this study is to apply some of this 
        information. To create a deliverable that can help interpret this information, 
        and what it may mean for the individual. There is a potential for this proposed 
        algorithm to fail, however, to see one that would truly work would be something 
        quite interesting. Despite the copious amounts of information out there already, 
        pizza newsletters, and academics seeking to understand their cultural icons, 
        there is always more to explore. There seems to be a serious lack of content in 
        the pizza algorithm department, so that is where this study will explore.
